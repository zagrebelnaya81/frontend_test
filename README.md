3. You project url is 'http://localhost:4200/'.
4. Follow the test instructions.

## Build	# What do you need to do?


Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.	Our project contains an image gallery that is loaded from 'Flickr', using a 'Get request'.
there are 100 images that are being loaded to the gallery.
The gallery images are related to a 'Tag' that can be insert in the header search bar.


## Running unit tests	The following changes need to be implemented to the gallery:
  1. Make images popup on click.
  2. Turn the Gallery into 'infinite-scrolling' gallery (for example: facebook feed).
  3. Add a uniq feature. Here is where you can go wild and show us what you can do.
  4. BONUS: Implement the infinite scrolling without using third party packages
